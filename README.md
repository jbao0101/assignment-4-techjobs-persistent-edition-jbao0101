#README.md

This is my final project from LaunchCode's LC101 course. This is the culmination of months worth of work, utilizing Java/SpringBoot, Thymeleaf for styling templates, 
JPA/Hibernate and MySQL Workbench for backend database management.

The goal of this project was to allow users to create, store, and display job listings with varying information such as job description, company name, location, skills
required, etc. This project uses an MVC approach and has a persistent relational database through MySQL workbench to store the job objects created by the user.
